# Fluxa Text Summarizer

Fluxa is a powerful, non-open-source application designed to summarize text using advanced machine learning models. It provides both text summarization and PDF processing, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting text from images embedded within PDFs.

## Features

- **Text Summarization**: Quickly condenses long texts into shorter summaries using a fine-tuned BART model.
- **PDF Summarization**: Extracts text from PDFs, including running OCR on images to identify and summarize the embedded text.

## How It Works

1. **Input Text Summarization**: Users can input long articles or pieces of text that they wish to summarize.
2. **PDF Upload**: The app allows users to upload PDF files. It will extract text from the PDF, including running OCR to recognize text in images, and then generate a concise summary.
3. **Advanced AI Models**: The app utilizes state-of-the-art models and transformers for generating high-quality summaries in real time.

## Access

The application is available online at [Fluxa](https://www.fluxa.pro/).

## Visual Assets

The project includes logos and visual assets, including a **Medium-size logo** located at `assets/logo.png`.

## Deployment
